Subject: Inquiry About DevOps Engineer Role (Role ID: 5594298)

Hi Christopher,

I hope you’re doing well. I came across the DevOps Engineer role (Role ID: 5594298) and wanted to check if the position is still open. While the role is listed as a Level 11 position, I’m currently at Level 9 and believe my skills and experience could still align well with the requirements.

I’m based in San Antonio, where the role is located, and I have a strong background in building and maintaining automated deployment pipelines, managing CI/CD processes, and working in Linux environments. I’ve also worked extensively with AWS and have experience supporting development teams and ensuring governance and standards for build automation.

I’d love to hear if this role is still available and if it’s worth applying. I’d also be happy to provide more details about my experience if helpful.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
Gisele Soubiega
