Subject: Introduction and Request for Support

Dear Ariel,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Gisele Soubeiga, and Chelsea Clay recently shared my one-pager with you as I am currently seeking a new role within AFS.

I have experience in DevOps, Cloud Engineering, and CI/CD pipelines, and I’m actively applying for roles that align with my skill set. Chelsea mentioned that you have visibility into current and upcoming opportunities, and I would greatly appreciate any guidance or support you could provide to help me identify roles that might be a good fit.

If you’re available, I’d be happy to discuss my background and skills further at your convenience. Please let me know if there’s a good time to connect or if there are specific opportunities I should explore.

Thank you for your time and support—I greatly appreciate it and look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Gisele Soubeiga
