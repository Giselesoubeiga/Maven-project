Subject: Roll-On Questions

Hi Kim,

I’m officially rolling onto the project today and was wondering if you could help me with two questions:
	1.	Do you know who my direct supervisor is?
	2.	Do you have any information about how to obtain my charge code?

Thank you so much for your assistance!

Best regards,
Gisele
