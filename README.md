Subject: Interest in AWS Cloud Engineer Role (Role ID: 5568573)

Hi Eric,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing this opportunity with me. The AWS Cloud Engineer role aligns closely with my experience, particularly in developing cloud infrastructure using Terraform, managing containers like Docker, and building CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployments.

In my current role, I’ve worked extensively with AWS services like EC2, S3, and ELB, along with implementing infrastructure-as-code solutions using Terraform. Additionally, I’ve optimized CI/CD pipelines with tools like Jenkins and GitLab, ensuring efficient workflows and secure deployments across environments.

I’ve reviewed the role description and am very interested in contributing to the FAR-Big Stone project. I’d love to set up a time to discuss how my background and skills can benefit your team. Please let me know a convenient time for us to connect.

Thank you again for considering me for this opportunity. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Gisele Soubiega
