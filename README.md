Hi Ahmad,

I hope you’re doing well. I came across the AWS Cloud Engineer role (Role ID: 5568573) and wanted to reach out directly to express my interest. This role aligns closely with my experience in AWS cloud infrastructure, Terraform, containerization with Docker, and CI/CD pipeline development.

I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute to the FAR-Big Stone project and would love to learn more about the team and its goals.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
