Hi Ariel,

Thank you for your response and the helpful guidance. I’ll continue applying to relevant roles on Staffer/MyScheduling and will reach out to the primary contacts as you suggested, including attaching my one-pager.

I appreciate being on your radar for one-off requests, and I’ll make sure to CC you on any follow-up emails to keep you in the loop. If there’s anything specific you come across that you think would be a good fit, I’d be grateful for the opportunity to discuss it further.

Thank you again for your support—I truly appreciate it.

Best regards,
Gisele
