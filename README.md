Here’s how you can include a note about attaching your one-pager in a professional and concise way:

Hi Daniel,

I hope you’re doing well. My name is Gisele, and I’m currently with AFS. As I approach the end of my current project, I’m actively exploring new opportunities and came across the Cloud Engineer - T1 role (Role ID: 5568360). This role aligns closely with my experience and skill set, particularly in AWS, Terraform, and CI/CD processes.

I’m very interested in this position and would love to discuss how my background could contribute to the success of the FAR-Angelite project. I’ve attached my one-pager to provide a quick overview of my experience and accomplishments.

Could we schedule a quick call or connect over email to discuss this opportunity further?

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Gisele S.
