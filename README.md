Subject: Interest in Cloud DevOps Engineer Role (Role ID: 5568573)

Hi Brandon,

I hope you’re doing well. My name is Gisele, and I’m currently with AFS. As I approach the end of my current project, I’m actively exploring new opportunities and came across the Cloud DevOps Engineer role (Role ID: 5568573). This position aligns closely with my experience and expertise, particularly in AWS, Infrastructure as Code, automation, and version control systems like Git.

I’ve attached my one-pager to provide a quick overview of my experience, which includes designing and maintaining CI/CD pipelines, implementing Terraform for infrastructure automation, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver scalable solutions. I’m very excited about the opportunity to contribute to the FAR-Big Stone project and would love to learn more about the team’s goals and how I can support its success.

Could we schedule a quick call or connect over email to discuss this opportunity further? I’d be happy to provide additional details or answer any questions.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Gisele Soubiega
