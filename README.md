Subject: Exciting Update

Hi Chelsea,

I hope you’re having a great day! I wanted to follow up and share some exciting news—I’ve recently secured a new project with USPS. I truly appreciate all the guidance and support you provided during my search, and I wanted to express my gratitude again for your help.

If there’s ever a way I can return the favor or assist in any way, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

Thank you again, and I hope we can stay in touch!

Best regards,
Gisele
