Hi [People Lead’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well. I just wanted to check in and share that everything in my current project has been going great—I really enjoy the work I do and appreciate the experience I’m gaining.

I also wanted to let you know that I’m expecting to go on maternity leave around May. I haven’t reached out to HR or my project lead yet, and I’d love any advice you might have on the best way to navigate the process. If there are specific steps I should take or things I should keep in mind, I’d really appreciate your guidance.

Looking forward to your thoughts, and thanks in advance for your help!

Best,
Gisele
