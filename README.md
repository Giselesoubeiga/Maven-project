Subject: Thank You and Next Steps

Hi Chelsea,

Thank you for forwarding my one-pager to Ariel Brest and for your guidance throughout this process. I truly appreciate your support.

I will reach out to Ariel as you suggested and continue exploring opportunities. If there’s anything else I should be doing in the meantime or any other contacts you think I should connect with, please let me know.

Thank you again for your help—I’m grateful for your assistance as I work to secure a new role.

Best regards,
Gisele
