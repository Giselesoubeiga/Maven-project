Hi AFS Absence Management Team,

I’m reaching out to request maternity leave, with an expected start date around [insert date]. I’d appreciate it if you could let me know what steps I need to take and send over any forms or info I’ll need to get things started.

Please let me know if there’s anything else you need from me.
