What excites you about this role?

I’m excited about this role because it offers the opportunity to work on complex cloud migration projects, which is an area I’ve always wanted to grow in. The idea of collaborating with architects, platform owners, and client teams to design efficient solutions and tackle technical challenges is something I genuinely enjoy.

The tools and methodologies mentioned, like Accelerate for Cloud (A4C) and myNav Migrate, provide a chance to work with innovative technologies while contributing to impactful results. It’s the blend of technical growth and meaningful teamwork that makes this role especially appealing to me.
