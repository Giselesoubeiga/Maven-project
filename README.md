Here’s a shorter, to-the-point version:

Hi [Name],

Thank you so much for considering me for [role/project name]. I wanted to let you know that I’ve recently accepted a new project and won’t be able to proceed with the interview process.

I truly appreciate your time and hope we can connect again in the future.

Best regards,
Gisele
