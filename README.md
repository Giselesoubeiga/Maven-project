Subject: Exploring New Opportunities

Hi [Name],

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to reach out because I’m currently exploring new opportunities and thought I’d check if you know of any roles that might fit my background.

I have experience working with AWS cloud platforms, Terraform for infrastructure-as-code, CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, Bitbucket, GitLab), and containerization tools like Docker and Kubernetes. I’ve focused on automating deployments, optimizing cloud environments, and collaborating with teams to ensure smooth and secure operations.

If you know of any open roles or someone hiring, I’d really appreciate any leads or referrals. I’m happy to send my resume if needed.

Thank you so much, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Gisele
