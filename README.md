Subject: Follow-Up on Application for Cloud Engineer - T1 Role (Role ID: 5568360)

Hi Jonathan,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to follow up on my recent application for the Cloud Engineer - T1 role (Role ID: 5568360). I’m very excited about this opportunity and wanted to share my one-pager for your reference, as it highlights my relevant experience and accomplishments.

I’ve worked extensively with AWS services, Terraform, Docker, and Kubernetes, and I’ve also led efforts to optimize CI/CD pipelines and troubleshoot complex cloud infrastructure issues. My recent projects have focused on designing scalable cloud environments, implementing infrastructure as code, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver reliable solutions.

This role aligns perfectly with my skills and career goals, and I’d love the chance to discuss how I can contribute to the FAR-Angelite project. Please let me know if there’s any additional information I can provide.

Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Gisele Soubiega
