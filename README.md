Here’s a clearer and more professional rewrite of the message:

Hi Nadeem,

I understand. Would you mind reaching out to Narasimha Thammineni to explain the issue with the 7.1.0 baseline? He is the lead for all AIO-related matters and might be able to assist further.

Just as an FYI, I’m transitioning to another team and currently have less focus on AIO-related work.

Thank you!

Let me know if you’d like further tweaks.
