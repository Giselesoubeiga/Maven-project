Subject: Inquiry About DevOps Opportunities

Hi Mitchell,

I hope you’re doing well. I came across the DevOps Engineer role (SE3) you’re hiring for, and while I understand it’s at a Career Level 7, I wanted to express my interest and share my profile for any opportunities within your network or team that might align with my current level (L9).

I have experience in AWS, CI/CD pipeline automation, infrastructure as code, and containerization, and I’ve contributed to projects delivering value through automation and scalable solutions. I’d be grateful if you could keep me in mind for any roles where I could contribute effectively.

If there’s someone you recommend I connect with, I’d appreciate any guidance you can provide. I’ve attached my one-pager for quick reference.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Giselle Soubeiga
