Subject: Quick Question About DevOps Engineer Role

Hi Matthew,

I hope you’re doing well. I came across the DevOps Engineer role (Role ID: 5529250) and wanted to check if the position is still open before I apply.

The role sounds like a great fit for my experience, especially with CI/CD pipelines, Docker, Kubernetes, and working on secure and scalable infrastructure. I’m really interested in learning more about the Full Metal Jacket project and how I might be able to contribute to the team.

Please let me know if you’re still hiring, and I’d be happy to share more about my background or answer any questions you have.

Thanks so much, and I look forward to hearing from you!

Best,
Gisele

This version is approachable and straightforward, while still professional. It shows genuine interest in the role without sounding overly formal. Let me know if you’d like further tweaks!
