Hi Won,

I wanted to discuss my schedule for the INT on-call rotation next week. My access to the INT environment had been disabled since May per Andrew’s instructions, and although David re-enabled it for me last week, I haven’t been added to any Slack channels or worked on any INT-related tasks during this time. I’m concerned about my ability to effectively handle on-call responsibilities without the necessary access or context.

Additionally, since I’m transitioning out of the team at the end of the month, would it be possible to reassign these responsibilities to someone with the required access and familiarity?

Let me know your thoughts!

Best regards,
Gisele
