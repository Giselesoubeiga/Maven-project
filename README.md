Subject: Follow-Up: Request for Support in Finding a New Role

Dear Ashley,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to follow up on our recent conversation regarding the TMP process and share an update on my progress.

I’ve been actively applying to roles that align with my skills on Staffer and My Scheduling and have also been reaching out to managers and senior managers to explore opportunities. However, I haven’t had any success so far, and no roles have come up yet.

I would greatly appreciate any additional support or guidance you can provide to help me identify and secure a new role. If you’re aware of any openings or can connect me with teams looking for someone with my background in DevOps, Cloud Engineering, and CI/CD pipelines, I would be extremely grateful.

Thank you again for your time and support—I truly appreciate it. Please let me know if there’s any further information or action needed from my end.

Best regards,
Gisele
