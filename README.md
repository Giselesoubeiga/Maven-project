I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to reach out to inform you that I’m expecting to go on maternity leave around May and would like to understand the process for requesting leave.

I haven’t formally reached out to my project lead yet, as I wanted to check with you first on the necessary steps and any paperwork or approvals I should be aware of. Please let me know the best way to proceed when you have a moment.

I appreciate your guidance and look forward to your response!

Best,
Gisele
