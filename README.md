Here’s a revised follow-up message without mentioning that you haven’t implemented her advice:

Hi Ariel,

I wanted to follow up and share some exciting news—I’ve secured a new role with USPS! Thank you so much for your guidance and support earlier today. Your advice and encouragement have been incredibly helpful during this process, and I’m truly grateful.

I look forward to staying connected and hope to cross paths again in the future. Please let me know if there’s ever anything I can do to return the favor.

Best regards,
Gisele

This keeps the tone positive and professional while focusing on the gratitude and maintaining the connection.
