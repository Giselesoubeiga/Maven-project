Hi AFS Absence Management Team,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out to formally request maternity leave, with an expected start date around [insert your expected start date, e.g., May 15, 2025].

I’d appreciate it if you could let me know the next steps and if there’s any paperwork or documentation I need to complete. I came across the Maternity Leave Application form and plan to submit it as instructed, but please let me know if anything else is required.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Best,
