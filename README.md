Your message is clear and professional. However, you can make it a bit more polished and structured for clarity. Here’s a refined version:

“Hi Claudius and Ismael, Pratik asked me to schedule a session with you to go over how our team grants access to other team members. Please let me know your availability, and I’ll coordinate a time that works for everyone. Thanks!”

This keeps it professional and polite while ensuring clarity.
