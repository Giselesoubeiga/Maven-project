Reaching out to people you don’t know on Teams can feel intimidating, but with a clear and professional approach, it can be highly effective. Here’s how to do it:

1. Find the Right People to Contact

	•	Use Teams Search to find people working in your area of interest or job family.
	•	Look for hiring managers, team leads, or recruiters.
	•	Use internal tools like MyScheduling or Workday to identify people tied to open roles or departments you’re interested in.

2. Draft a Short, Professional Message

Keep it concise and respectful. Your goal is to introduce yourself, express interest, and attach your one-pager resume.

Message Example:

Hi [Name],

I hope you’re doing well. My name is [Your Name], and I’m currently transitioning off my project within Accenture Federal Services. I wanted to reach out because I’m actively looking for new opportunities in [specific area, e.g., DevOps, Cloud Engineering, CI/CD Pipelines, etc.].

I’ve attached my one-pager resume for your reference. If you know of any roles available on your team or elsewhere within AFS that match my skills, I’d greatly appreciate it if you could let me know—or connect me with someone who might be hiring.

Thank you for your time, and I’d be happy to discuss my background further if needed. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Current Role/Team]

3. Attach Your One-Pager Resume

	•	Save your one-pager as a PDF with a clear file name (e.g., Gisele_Soubiega_Resume.pdf) to make it look polished.
	•	Attach it to your Teams message before sending.

4. Follow Up (If Necessary)

If you don’t hear back within 5-7 days:
	•	Send a polite follow-up message.

Follow-Up Example:

Hi [Name], I just wanted to follow up on my previous message. I understand you’re busy, but I’d greatly appreciate any guidance or connections regarding roles within AFS that align with my skills. Thank you again for your time!

5. General Tips

	•	Personalize Each Message: Avoid sounding like you’re sending a mass message. Mention something relevant about their role or team if possible.
	•	Be Polite and Respectful: Remember, you’re asking for their help.
	•	Cast a Wide Net: Reach out to multiple people across different teams or departments.
