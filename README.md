Here’s the corrected version of your message:

Hello Abdulai,

I hope you’re having a great day. I wanted to thank you for taking the time to speak with me about your team and the project you’re working on. I also wanted to inform you that I have accepted a new project. It was a tough decision, as I was very interested in the opportunity with your team, but I wanted to be upfront and keep you informed.

Thank you again for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Gisele
