Teams Message:

Hi Laura,

I hope you’re doing well. I recently came across the SCON_Security Engineer Jr/Mid role for the FAR:Pompano project and wanted to express my interest. My experience managing and troubleshooting Linux servers (CentOS/RHEL), working with AWS environments, and automating enterprise infrastructure aligns closely with the needs of this position.

While I don’t have direct cybersecurity experience, I’m eager to grow in this area and contribute my skills in infrastructure management and problem-solving to the team. I’d love the chance to discuss how I could support the goals of this project. Please let me know if you’re available for a quick chat or if there’s someone else I should connect with.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
Gisele

This version keeps it professional but concise for Teams. If the person shows interest, you can follow up with more details via email or during a conversation. Let me know if this works!
