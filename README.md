Thank you for clarifying! Here’s a revised version that better reflects your background without overstating cybersecurity experience:

How does your experience and aspirations make you a fit for this role?

While I haven’t worked directly in cybersecurity, I bring strong experience managing and troubleshooting Linux servers, particularly in enterprise environments, which is a key part of this role. I’ve worked extensively with CentOS and RHEL, handling day-to-day administration, resolving issues, and ensuring systems run smoothly. My experience in cloud environments, like AWS, and automation tools also aligns with the technical foundation this role requires.

I’m excited to apply my skills in a new way and expand into cybersecurity by contributing to the maintenance and improvement of security tools. This role feels like the perfect opportunity to take my existing expertise and apply it to a field I’m eager to grow in.

What excites you about this role?

What excites me most about this role is the chance to work on challenging, hands-on projects that involve troubleshooting and building tools to enhance security. I’m also drawn to the opportunity to grow my technical skills by working with security-focused platforms like Splunk and SOAR tools, which are areas I’m eager to learn more about.

I enjoy working in dynamic environments where I can solve problems, learn new technologies, and contribute to meaningful projects. This role feels like a great fit for how I want to develop my career—taking my Linux and cloud expertise to the next level by diving deeper into security-focused work.

This version keeps it honest and ties your existing strengths to the role while expressing your eagerness to learn and grow. Let me know if it resonates!
