Subject: Interest in SCON_Security Engineer Jr/Mid Role

Hi Laura,

I hope you’re doing well. My name is Gisele Soubiega, and I recently came across the SCON_Security Engineer Jr/Mid position for the FAR:Pompano project. After reviewing the role, I feel my background in managing and troubleshooting Linux servers (CentOS/RHEL), working with AWS cloud environments, and my proactive approach to solving technical challenges make me a strong fit for this position.

In my current role at Accenture Federal Services, I’ve worked extensively on configuring and administering enterprise systems, automating deployments, and maintaining infrastructure reliability. Additionally, I have experience with Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and scripting to ensure efficient processes across various environments. Although my direct cybersecurity experience is limited, I’m eager to apply my skills to this field and grow in areas like security engineering and using tools such as Splunk or SOAR.

I’d love the chance to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the goals of this project. Please let me know if you’d be available for a quick chat or if there are additional steps I can take to move forward in the process.

Thank you for your time and consideration!

Best regards,
Gisele Soubiega
Tech Architecture Specialist | Accenture Federal Services
