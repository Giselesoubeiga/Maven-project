Subject: Interest in Cloud Platform Architect Role (Role ID: 5451251)

Hi [J. Moskowitz],

I hope you’re doing well. My name is Gisele, and I’m currently with AFS. I came across the Cloud Platform Architect role (Role ID: 5451251) and wanted to reach out directly. This position aligns well with my experience in managing AWS cloud environments, implementing automation tools like Ansible and Terraform, and supporting production and development systems.

I’m particularly excited about the opportunity to work on the Hemingway project and contribute to its success. I’d love to learn more about the project goals and how my background could support the team.

I’ve attached my one-pager for your review. Please let me know if we could set up a quick call or Teams chat to discuss further.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Gisele Soubiega
