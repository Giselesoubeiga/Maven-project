Subject: Timesheet Submission - Missing Charge Code

Good Morning Patrick,

I hope you had a wonderful Christmas!

Today is my roll-on to my new project, and I was notified to submit my timesheet. However, I have not yet received a charge code. Could you please advise me on what steps I should take to proceed?

Thank you for your help!

Best regards,
Gisele
